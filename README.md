### Hi there ðŸ‘‹
## Facundo Lizardo
- I am dedicated to creating innovative and robust web solutions. My experience ranges from front-end development with React to the implementation of servers and databases with Node.js and PostgresSQL. Over the past year, I have devoted myself to creating and contributing to various web projects, such as EducaStream. I take pride in my proactiveness, problem-solving ability, and capacity for learning. I am excited about the opportunity to bring my skills and passion to full-stack development in your company and contribute to the success of each project.
